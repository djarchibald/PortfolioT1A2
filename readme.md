## Description of my portfolio site:
Welcome to my portfolio website! It is designed to present me as a web developer to prospective employers or recruiters looking to hire a junior developer. As well as providing users  - prospective employers - multiple ways of contacting me, the site provides users with an overview about my career to date, and account of my decision to change careers and transition into tech, as well as a brief summary of my interests outside work.  Using the links on the 'About' page and in the footer respectively , users can access my CV and Linkedin account, both of which give a more in depth look at the transferable skills I have demonstrated in my career to-date and will in the future cover the technical skills I aquire during the bootcamp.  

As someone extremely new to coding - this site is my first start to finish build -  my overall approach to was to keep things relatively simple wherever possible while still meeting the assignment objectives and criteria outlined in the marking rubric. The site is designed to evolve in line with my technical skills as they improve over time - it is my intent that it will become significantly more sophisticated over the course of the bootcamp, ultimately allowing me to credibly use it as a key part of my job search.

## Features & Functionality

The 'keep it simple' approach informed the majority of decisions I took as I built the site. From the outset I was keen that my website had a clean, uncluttered look and feel, with intuitive navigation and functionality whether viewed on a phone, tablet or desktop sized device. 

Accessibility was also an important consideration, including in my decision to use sans-serif style fonts throughout the website, as well as a reasonably high contrast colour-scheme which sees either dark text on light backgrounds or light text on dark backgrounds, both of which I hope will assist any users with dyslexia or sight issues. The site also features alt-text for all images used. 

Critically, users are able to contact me through every page on the site - either connecting to my social media accounts (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and github), using the contact form to send me a message, or by clicking on the mail or phone links in the footer.  

As you can see in the sitemap below, my website consists of a home/landing page, about, blog and contact pages. From the blog page, users are able to access 5 example (and currently dummy) blog posts.

**Sitemap**

As mentioned above, all pages have a consistent header and footer. Aesthetically, I wanted to use these to reinforce to the user the sense of clean modern branding, allowing users to easily identify what website they're on, and to give a sense of consistency accross the different pages. And in terms of utility, they do much of the heavy lifting on the site.  The header allows users to navigate easily between pages and access the information they're looking for. The footer is used to allow users to contact me regardless of where they are on the website. As the main purpose of the site is ultimately to assist in getting me a job, I wanted to make it as easy as possible for users to connect with me whether through my social media accounts or the clickable mail and phone links. This means that a time poor user doesn't have to spend time navigating to the contact page if they decide they want to get in touch, but rather can simply click on any of the links.

The screenshot below shows a mobile phone view of the header, including clickable logo and links to other pages, and footer, with links to social media, as well as clickable phone and mail links:

A further feature of the site is the contact form on the 'contact' page.  While at the moment there is no back-end behind the form enabling it to work, it will in the future allow users a simple way to send me their contact details and message. As you can see in the screenshot below, the form has been styled to fit the overall look of the site. It matches the color scheme and generally maintains the simple, uncluttered feel. though the submit button does not actually do anything as yet, you will see that it changes color when clicked, emphasising to users that they have succsesfully clicked the button.

In line with the assignment rubric, my site is responsive. The screenshots below show the difference in the landing page at mobile and desktop views. In the early design stage I decided to use essentially an enlarged version of the mobile site for tablets, and so set media queries to change the layout for any screens above 834 pixels (the size of an ipad Pro 11"). This means anything below that will use the mobile view (scaled appropriately for the screen size) but anything above that - laptops, desktops and larger tablets, will display the desktop layout. You can see in the images below for example that on the homepage, the desktop view sees the text move alongside the image, rather than being displayed as a single column. The image and text also changes size to reflect the larger screen. The about page reacts similarly.

The blog page is a further example of the media queries in action. You can see in the screenshots below that in the desktop view, the blogs are rearranged compared to the single column on a mobile device:

## Tech Stack
The site was built using HTML and vanilla CSS, and deployed using netlify from my github repo.

## Target Audience
As above, thre target audience for the site is prospective employers or recruiters looking to hire a junior developer.

## Wireframes/Mock-Ups
Never having used Figma or anything similar before I found it an incredibly useful step int he process. Without a set idea in mind when I first considered what my site would look like, I found using the mock-ups helped me focus on things that really needed to be included, and not spend time worrying about any nice-to-haves. It also allowed me to assess quickly how best to lay the site out in line with my aspriation for a clean, uncluttered site. Screenshots of mobile, tablet and desktop views below:
