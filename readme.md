## Description 
My portfolio website is designed to present me as a web developer to prospective employers who may be looking to hire a junior developer. It provides users with detail about what I'm currently doing, the skills I have demonstrated in my career to-date and and will aquire during the bootcamp, as well as giving a brief introduction to me outside the professional setting. It allows users to conatc me either through the contact form or the links to my personal social media accounts (Linkedin, Instagram, Twitter and Github).  

The site was built using HTML and vanilla CSS, and deployed using netlify via my github repo.

As someone extremely new to coding - this site is my first start to finish build -  my overall approach to building the site was to keep things relatively simple wherever possible while still meeting the assignment objectives and criteria outlined in the marking rubric. The site is designed to evolve in line with my technical skills as they improve over time - it is my intent that the site will be significantly more sophisticated in roughly 6-8 months time, when I will use it as part of my job search.

This approach imnformed the majority of decisions I took. From the outset I was keen that my website had a clean, uncluttered feeling, with intuitivve navigation and functionality. Accsesibility was also an important consideration for me, and and was largely behind my decision to use sans-serif style fonts throughout the website, as well as a high contrats colour-scheme (with the main body of pages consisteng of dark text on a light background, while headers and footers use light text on a drak background.)

## HTML
Created the basic structure in terminal, moved to VS Code. Then created the header, linked the CSS stylesheet and set out other main containers (main and footer)

Header contains title of website and navigation

## CSS
Established a CSS stylesheet. Defined colorscheme, and added colors to text and backgrounds. 
Flexed the header to align the elements within it.
